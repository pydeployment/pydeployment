# Using a Custom Appimagetool Binary

Specify your own appimagetool binary.

---

Although appimagetool binaries are included with PyDeployment, you can instead
choose to use your own appimagetool binary by providing the path to the binary
to `APPIMAGETOOL` in the environment file or `--appimagetool` on the command
line.
