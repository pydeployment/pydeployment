# Setting Build Options

Set options for your project.

---

There are two ways to set values for your project using PyDeployment: using an
environment file, and using command line arguments. Both methods can be used
simultaneously, with command line arguments overriding the options in the
environment file. Click on the options below to learn about each of these
methods.

See available build options in [Build Options](../build-options.md).

* [Using an Environment File](env-file.md)
* [Using the Command Line](command-line.md)
* [Using Both](using-both.md)
